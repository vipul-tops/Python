#Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django?
"""
To load data into Django you have to use the command line

 ---Django-admin.py loaddata--
 
The command line will searches the data and loads the contents
of the named fixtures into the database.

The Django loaddata command allows you to load data from a file
into the database. Typically, you use the dumpdata command to export
data from a database and use the loaddata command to import data
from the file into the same or another database
